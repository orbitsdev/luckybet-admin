User::where('role', 'teller')->where('coordinator_id', auth()->id())->get();
```

### Blade Styling Tips
- Use `bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md` for cards
- Use `text-sm font-medium text-gray-500` for labels
- Use conditional classes for colors:
  ```blade
  {{ $value >= 0 ? 'text-green-600' : 'text-red-600' }}
  ```
